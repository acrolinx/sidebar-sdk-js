## The Acrolinx Sidebar

The Acrolinx Sidebar is designed to show up beside the window where you edit your content.
You use it for checking, reviewing, and correcting your content.
To get an impression what the Sidebar looks like in existing integrations, have a look at
[Sidebar Quick Start](https://support.acrolinx.com/hc/en-us/articles/10252588984594-Sidebar-Quick-Start).

## Prerequisites

Please contact [Acrolinx SDK support](https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-coding-guidance/blob/master/topics/sdk-support.md)
for consulting and getting your integration certified.
This sample works with a test license on an internal Acrolinx URL.
This license is only meant for demonstration and developing purposes.
Once you finished your integration, you'll have to get a license for your integration from Acrolinx.
  
Acrolinx offers different other SDKs, and examples for developing integrations.

Before you start developing your own integration, you might benefit from looking into:

* [Build With Acrolinx](https://support.acrolinx.com/hc/en-us/categories/10209837818770-Build-With-Acrolinx),
* the [Guidance for the Development of Acrolinx Integrations](https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-coding-guidance),
* the [Acrolinx SDKs](https://github.com/acrolinx?q=sdk), and
* the [Acrolinx Demo Projects](https://github.com/acrolinx?q=demo).

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install the SDK to your npm-based Acrolinx Integration project call:

```bash
npm install @acrolinx/sidebar-sdk
```

### Instructions for Contributing Code

[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## SDK Features

The SDK provides [adapters](https://acrolinx.github.io/sidebar-sdk-js/pluginDoc/modules/adapters_adapterinterface.html) for:

* `contentEditable` `div`-elements,
* `input` text elements,
* CodeMirror,
* CKEditor,
* Xeditor,
* TinyMCE, and a
* `MultiEditorAdapter` that can be used to combine different adapters as one document.

If you need to support other editors, sometimes the `ContentEditableAdapter` works without any changes.
If not, implement the [`AdapterInterface`](https://acrolinx.github.io/sidebar-sdk-js/pluginDoc/modules/adapters_adapterinterface.html).

### Deprecation
> :warning: **Sidebar v14 is getting deprecated**

The process to update your existing integration is straightforward and involves the following steps:
1. Update to the Latest SDK Version: Please ensure that youâ€™ve updated to the latest SDK version. The most recent version can be found on our NPM package page [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@acrolinx/sidebar-sdk).
2. Remove the Initialization Config (Optional): If your current implementation includes the initialization config `minimumSidebarVersion=14.x.x`, we recommend removing this configuration.
