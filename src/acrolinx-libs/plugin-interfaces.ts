/**
 * This document describes the interface of the Acrolinx Sidebar.
 *
 * Let's understand how the typical bootstrapping of an integration and the Acrolinx Sidebar works:
 *
 * 1) Load the host editor of your integration.
 *
 * 2) Load your integration code.
 *
 * 3) Register your integration as an AcrolinxPlugin.
 *  ```
 *  var acrolinxPlugin = {...}
 *  ```
 *  Check the {@link AcrolinxPlugin} interface for required methods, that you have to implement.
 *
 * 4) Load the sidebar and the referenced libraries code (usually sidebar.js, libs.js, sidebar.css).
 *
 * 5) Once the sidebar has finished loading it will request the integration to initialize by calling
 *    {@link AcrolinxPlugin.requestInit|requestInit}.
 *
 * 6) The AcrolinxPlugin now must call {@link AcrolinxSidebar.init|init}.
 *
 * 7) Once the init process has finished, the plug-in will be notified:
 *    {@link AcrolinxPlugin.onInitFinished|onInitFinished}.
 *
 * 8) After initializing the sidebar will call {@link AcrolinxPlugin.configure|configure} and push the latest
 * configuration to the plug-in.
 *
 * 9) If the user pushes the button "Check", {@link AcrolinxPlugin.requestGlobalCheck|requestGlobalCheck} is called.
 *
 * 10) The acrolinxPlugin must call {@link AcrolinxSidebar.checkGlobal|checkGlobal} to perform a check.
 *
 * 11) When the check finished, {@link AcrolinxPlugin.onCheckResult|onCheckResult} is called and the sidebar displays
 * cards for the issues.
 *
 * 12) If the user clicks a card {@link AcrolinxPlugin.selectRanges|selectRanges} is called
 *
 * 13) When the user selects a replacement {@link AcrolinxPlugin.replaceRanges|replaceRanges} is called.
 *
 * For a minimal integration (not feature complete) you must implement {@link requestInit}, {@link requestGlobalCheck},
 * {@link configure}, {@link selectRanges} and {@link replaceRanges}.
